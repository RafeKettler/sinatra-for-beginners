### Setup instructions ###

Assuming you already have a suitable ruby and rubygems installation (if not, go to http://rvm.io), just run `gem install bundler` (again, if you haven't already), then run `bundle install`. You should be able to run all of the code snippets.

To run the server for a particular stage, simply type `ruby stageX.rb`. C-c or C-d when you're done to kill the script.
